# CS50-Week-0-Scratch-Protect-Night-City-

Protect Night City! is a short game designed on Scratch that aims to play out like an arcade game. You use WASD or Arrow keys to move the character, and press space to shoot beams at wherever your mouse is aiming at. Your goal is to get to 50 points, where you'll get the opportunity to either stop the game, or go on to an infinite stage until you lose. You lose when a bat manages to touch your character.
